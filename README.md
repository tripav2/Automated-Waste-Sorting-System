# Automated Robotic Waste Sorting System

This project features the design and development of an automated recycling system that sorts containers based on their material composition. The system includes both a virtual simulation and a physical prototype, combining robotics, sensor integration, and control systems to handle and separate recyclable items with accuracy and efficiency.

## 🛠 Features
- **Line-following Robot**: Navigates along a defined path to move containers between collection and sorting points.
- **Material Detection**: Integrated sensors detect the type of material (e.g., metal, plastic) for accurate sorting.
- **Automated Bin Sorting**: Containers are automatically placed into designated bins based on material properties.
- **Virtual Simulation**: Built using Quanser software to simulate robotic arm movements, hopper interactions, and bin placement before hardware deployment.
- **Physical Prototype**: Includes 3D-printed and laser-cut mechanical components connected to actuators for real-world container handling.

## 🧰 Technologies and Tools
- **Quanser Virtual Robotics Environment**
- **3D Printing & Laser Cutting for Prototype Assembly**
- **Embedded Systems for Robot Control**
- **Sensor Integration for Material Recognition**
- **Mechanical Actuation Systems**

## ▶️ How It Works
1. **Material Detection**: As containers enter the system, sensors detect the material type.
2. **Decision Making**: The robot determines the correct bin for each container.
3. **Line Following and Transport**: The robot follows a programmed path to approach the bins.
4. **Placement**: Containers are accurately deposited into their respective bins via actuated mechanical components.
5. **Simulation Testing**: All movements and interactions were validated in a Quanser virtual environment before hardware assembly.
